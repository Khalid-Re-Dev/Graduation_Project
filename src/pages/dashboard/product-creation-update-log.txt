Errors Fixed in API Integration:
- Requests for product creation now use POST /dashboard/products/ with all required fields.
- Requests for product update now use PATCH/PUT /dashboard/products/{product_id}/ with all required fields.
- Payloads now include: name, description, price, original_price, category_id, brand_id, image_url, video_url, release_date, is_active, in_stock, stock, shop_id.
- Image upload is handled as FormData if a file is selected, otherwise image_url is sent as a string.
- All requests send proper Authorization headers via apiService.
- UI now validates all required fields before sending requests.

Fields Validated/Added to UI:
- name (required)
- description
- price (required)
- original_price (required)
- category_id (required, select)
- brand_id
- image_url (or file upload)
- video_url
- release_date
- is_active (checkbox)
- in_stock (checkbox)
- stock (required)
- shop_id (auto-filled if available)

Image Handling Improvements:
- User can upload an image file or provide an image URL.
- If a file is uploaded, it is sent as FormData with the key 'image'.
- If only a URL is provided, it is sent as 'image_url'.
- Client-side validation ensures only one method is used at a time.

Confirmation:
- Product creation and update requests now match backend expectations for both required fields and file handling.
- UI is user-friendly, supports all fields, and provides clear error/success feedback.
- Old modal logic removed; product management is now via dedicated pages for clarity and maintainability.
