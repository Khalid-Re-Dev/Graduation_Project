# Product API Integration Migration Summary

## What was changed:
- All product data fetching, details, new, and popular product logic now exclusively use the live API at https://binc-b-1.onrender.com/api/.
- Removed all fallback logic to mock data from:
  - `src/services/product.service.js`
  - `src/store/productSlice.jsx`
- Added a clear comment to `src/services/productService.js` marking it as deprecated for production (mock only).

## Details:
- No product data will be loaded from local mock files in production. All product-related Redux thunks and service functions now throw errors or return empty arrays if the API fails, instead of using mock data.
- All product lists, product details, new products, and popular products are now fetched directly from the live backend.
- The Redux slice (`productSlice.jsx`) will only show real API data or an error/empty state if the API fails.

## Professional Practices:
- All API endpoints are now consistent and use the new live backend.
- No logic, state, or component structure was changed except to remove mock fallback.
- The code is now production-grade and will not show fake/mock data to users.

## Next Steps:
- Test all product-related flows (listing, details, new, popular) to ensure correct data is shown from the live backend.
- For local development, you may still use `productService.js` by importing it only in dev/test environments.

If you need to re-enable mock data for local development, use environment variables or a config flag to switch between API and mock sources.
