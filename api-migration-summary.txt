API Migration Summary
====================

‚úîÔ∏è All files and components that were updated:
- src/config/api.config.js

üîÅ Old URL ‚Üí New URL mapping for every endpoint:
- Old: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/... or http://localhost:8000/api/... or http://localhost:5000/api/...
- New: https://binc-b-1.onrender.com/api/...

‚úÖ HTTP methods used:
- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE (all handled via apiService and API_BASE_URL)

üîí Token headers or authentication considerations:
- Authorization: Bearer <token> header is preserved via apiService.getHeaders()
- No changes to token logic; all tokens are still sent as before

‚ùó Any broken or skipped routes:
- None detected. All API calls are routed through API_BASE_URL and will now use the live backend.

Notes:
- If you want to make the API base URL dynamic, you can use a .env file and reference process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL in api.config.js.
- All endpoints, including authentication, products, recommendations, favorites, comparison, dashboard, etc., are now routed to the live backend.
- No logic, component, or state changes were made.
